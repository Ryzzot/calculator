This is a simple calculator GUI written in Python using the Tkinter library. It features two input fields for numbers, a drop-down menu for selecting the operator, and a "Calculate" button. When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the script performs the appropriate calculation and displays the result. It is a basic calculator but can be easily customized to suit your needs. It is a good starter project for those who are new to GUI programming in python.
